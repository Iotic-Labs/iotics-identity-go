## Identity API

The identity API is used to manage identities and authentication in the Iotics Host.
The API is split in 2 levels according to the user needs:

* [High level identity API](pkg/api): minimal set of features to interact with Iotics Host
* [Advanced identity API](pkg/advancedapi): set of features for advanced identities management

## How to
