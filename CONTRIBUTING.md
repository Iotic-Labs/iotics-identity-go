# Contributing to Iotics Identity SDK in Go

`iotics-identity-go` is an open source project and accepts contributions.

## Becoming a contributor

The first step is to configure your environment.

Please follow the steps outlined in ["Becoming a contributor" (golang.org)](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#contributor) as the setup for contributing to the `iotics-identity-go` project is identical to that for contributing to the `go` project.

## Before contributing code

The project welcomes submissions, but to make sure things are well coordinated we ask that contributors discuss any significant changes before starting work. Best practice is to connect your work to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/iotics-identity-go/issues), either by filing a new issue or by claiming an existing issue.
